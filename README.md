# Eames Institute Technology Radar

This repo houses a CSV outlining our stance on various technologies, to be used with the [Thoughtworks technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar) tool.

The categorization as outlined below is based on much of what Artsy has shared in [their in-the-open documentation and work](https://github.com/artsy/README).

- **Adopt:** Reasonable defaults for most work. These choices have been exercised successfully in production there
  is a critical mass of engineers (>=2) comfortable working with them.
- **Trial:** These technologies are being evaluated in limited circumstances. We don’t have enough
  production experience to recommend them for high-risk use cases, but they may be worth
  consideration if your project seems like a fit.
- **Assess:** Technologies we are interested in and maybe even built proofs-of-concept for, but haven’t yet formally trialed.
- **Hold:** Based on our experience, these technologies should be avoided. We’ve found them to be flawed, immature,
  or simply supplanted by better alternatives. In some cases these remain in legacy production uses, but we should
  take every opportunity to retire or migrate away.
