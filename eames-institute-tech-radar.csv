Cloudflare,trial,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A platform that offers a wide array of services including content delivery network (CDNs), cybersecurity, DDoS mitigation, and domain registration.</p><p>💭 Can we avoid it? Would love to if so due to crappy leadership behavior historically.</p>"
AWS,trial,platforms,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ An enormous suite of cloud computing platforms offered by Amazon. Sort of unavoidable in a modern tech stack.</p><p>💭 But *could* we avoid it? Would love to if so.</p>
Docker,trial,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications.</p><p>💭 Very useful in many cases, but might not strictly be necessary depending upon our stack.</p>"
TypeScript,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A strongly-typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, allowing great error reporting when types don’t match across packages or applications.</p><p>💭 Can slow down development a bit though if you aren’t accustomed to strongly typed languages.</p>"
Split testing,assess,techniques,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A method of conducting controlled experiments with goal of improving a specific metric.</p>
Terraform,assess,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ An infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources.</p><p>💭 We needed this for the Wagtail site, hopefully not moving forward.</p>"
Webpack,assess,tools,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ An open-source module bundler for JavaScript.</p>
Pair programing,trial,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ An Agile software development technique where two developers team together on one computer.</p><p>💭 Can significantly speed up the PR review process, particularly for what would otherwise be a large PR.</p>"
Heroku,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A PaaS allowing developers to build, run, and operate apps in the cloud.</p><p>💭 Worthwhile, but not necessary if we go with headless architecture + Vercel. Might be stagnating following Salesforce purchase, but then again, sometimes “stagnant” is just a glass-half-empty word for “stable”.</p>"
Visual regression testing,assess,techniques,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ An automated way for checking design accuracy across a website when code changes have been made.</p><p>💭 Essential to avoid unintended consequences.</p>
Directus,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A “composable data platform” that can be used as a hosted headless CMS.</p><p>💭 A <em>very</em> close second to Sanity, but ultimately ruled out for v2 website due to cost and Sanity’s slightly better fit in terms of purpose (more of a CMS rather than an all-in-one platform. Keeping this in the “assess” ring though since it may be appropriate in the future.</p>"
Web components,assess,tools,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A native suite of technologies allowing creation of reusable custom elements and utilize them in web apps. Support varies as of March 2024.</p>
HTMX,assess,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A dependency-free, browser-oriented JavaScript library to access modern browser features (AJAX requests, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, Server Sent Emails, etc.) directly from HTML.</p>"
P3 color,assess,tools,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A new-ish alternative color space supporting a wider range of colors than RGB.</p>

Percy,assess,platforms,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A visual regression testing tool / platform.</p>
Python,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ An “interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics”.</p><p>💭 Previously used on our Wagtail site. Nothing inherently wrong with it, but in situations where Python might be required, we would rather lean towards JavaScript.</p>"
Wagtail,hold,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ An open-source Django CMS powered by Python.</p><p>💭 Similar to WordPress in that it can be used headlessly, but not ideal since there aren’t many serverless options (if any).</p>"
CloudCannon,hold,platforms,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A Git-backed headless CMS with hosting.</p><p>💭 Ruled out due to issues with references to deleted content in relation fields.</p>
Tina (née Forestry),hold,platforms,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A Git-backed headless CMS (no hosting).</p><p>💭 Ruled out due to poor Insights data in their GitHub repo. Not a great sign in combination with so many bug issues open.</p>
Decap (née Netlify CMS),hold,platforms,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A Git-backed headless CMS.</p><p>💭 Ruled out due to issues with references to deleted content in relation fields.</p>
WordPress Headless,hold,tools,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ The elder statesman of CMSs.</p><p>💭 Ruled out because it doesn’t offer as much flexibility as other possibilities, such as Sanity.</p>"
Strapi,hold,tools,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ An open source headless CMS that can be self-hosted or not.</p><p>💭 Certain functionality doesn’t seem as developed as Sanity (and vice versa...)</p>
Contentful,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ One of the most major headless CMSs available, possibly biggest market share.</p><p>💭 Very similar to Sanity in many ways, but Sanity seems stronger in terms of overall direction and UI. Contentful is also pricier.</p>"
eMuseum by Gallery Systems,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A museum management system.</p><p>💭 Terrible support, terrible softare, terrible UI, terrible pricing. 💩</p>"
Render,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A unified cloud to build and run apps and websites, a Heroku alternative.</p><p>💭 Impression is that pricing is more competitive than HEroku, particularly when scaling, but has more limited hosting regions and a less developed community / ecosystem. Seems like they want to focus more on Enterprise.</p>"
Fly.io,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A platform that “transforms containers into micro-VMs that run on our hardware”, a Heroku alternative.</p><p>💭 More competitive pricing than Heroku, supposedly faster than Render. But not great downtime metrics.</p>"
Hugo,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,<p>ℹ️ A fast static site generator written in Go.</p><p>💭 No client-side support and a hassle to use with headless CMS.</p>
SvelteKit,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<p>ℹ️ A Svelte-powered framework, a component based system for breaking HTML, CSS, and JS in to small, reusable components. Next.js is to React as SvelteKit is to Svelte.</p><p>💭 Not impressed with our experience of it, and feel like we don’t need so much server-side rendering (SSR).</p>"
